          <h4>
            My name is Calvin Cheung.
          </h4>
          <p class="about-description">
            UX Designer, Web Developer, Gym Rat, Runner, Snowboarder, and Anime Enjoyer. As a designer, I strive to create experiences that are not only usable and accessible, but enjoyable. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            I thrive in fast paced environments where I get to contribute to a variety of different projects. Being driven and a quick learner, I always put my best foot forward and tend to get lost in my work.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            Having had the privilege to work with a diverse cast of people on a variety of different projects, I've been able to immerse myself in different user groups and practice empathy wherever I end up.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            Listed below are my core values and some things I keep in mind when designing. These beliefs extend past my design work and are a part of who I am and what I believe.

    <!-- My Values -->

        </h2>
        <p>
          Being empathetic is something I take great pride in, especially as a designer. I love immersing myself in the shoes of others and seeing things in a new light. Understanding people is something I think I've always been pretty good at, and something I would like to make a living out of.
        </p>

      <div class="value-item">
        <h2 class="neon">
          C<span class="flicker-slow">u</span>riousi<span class="flicker-fast">t</span>y
        </h2>
        <p>
          I attribute a lot of my creative ideas to my curiousity. I'm constantly asking myself what-if questions and always want to find out more. This can lead to some ridiculous outcomes, but curiousity allows me to see everything as a learning experience and leads me to think "at least I tried."
        </p>

      <div class="value-item">
        <h2 class="neon"><span class="flicker-slow">I</span>nclusi<span class="flicker-fast">v</span>ity</h2>
        <p>
          Inclusivity, especially in the world of technology, is something I like to emphasize. There are many people in the world with different levels of ability and different socioeconomic conditions. I think it's important to always consider everyone and ensure technological advancements don't further widen the gap between rich and poor. After all, technology is supposed to improve <em>everyone's</em> quality of life.
